# PairProgramming

**Project by Natasha Kabasa and Brayan Pichardo**

In this project, we used a YouTube Api to create a program that can be used by people who want to be YouTube content creators.
This project would help the user gather information that can help them with deciding the type of content they should create in
order to monetize their YouTube account.  

## Installation
Simple YouTube API needs API keys from Google in order to be able to make queries to YouTube.

To install on your terminal, enter:
pip install google-api-client

## Generating YouTube API Keys
1. Log into https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Create a new Project
3. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com
4. Click Credentials
5. Click Create Credentials

Since this code implements non-user data,
*For non-user data*
    1. Select API Key
    2. Paste the key into a file

## How to run the code
